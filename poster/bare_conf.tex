% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[10pt, conference, compsocconf]{IEEEtran}

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.


\usepackage{url}
\usepackage{subfig}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}



% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{MOTIVATION}
% no \IEEEPARstart

Intra-operative X-Ray is essential during some surgeries, such as
percutaneous coronary intervention. The 2D X-Ray images have many
shortcomings such as viewing angle dependence, magnification factor,
overlapping, and the blurring between vessels, background, and other
tissues/organs. Great efforts have been carried out on 3D
reconstruction of coronary arteries to overcome the shortcomings of 2D
images. Current 3D reconstruction methods mostly rely on the
registration between image pairs, which are generally hard to enforce
constraints such as consistency and continuity. To overcome these
shortcomings, we develop an efficient vessel reconstruction system
based on multiple X-Ray views. We demonstrate our system in coronary
artery reconstruction for percutaneous coronary intervention surgery
to help doctors understand the spatial configuration of coronary
arteries of specific patient during operation.

\section{METHOD}
% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.

\textbf{A. Data acquisition and preprocessing.} For all procedures, we use
two types of data. One is the synthetic data from our simulation system.
Another one is the real data from clinical angiogram. We select one image
from each view within mostly the same cardiac cycle and use them to
reconstruct the vessels. To overcome the shortcomings such as the low image
contrast, the low lumen with the wide dynamic range of original angiograms,
we apply multi-scale retinex (MSR) enhancement proposed by
Rahman~\cite{rahman1996multi} on each image.

\textbf{B. Vessel extraction.} After obtaining the high-contrast
images pre-processed by MSR, we use the approach proposed
by~\cite{Frangi}. It relies on a multi-scale Hessian matrix that
enhances the vascular structure. After processing the image, we
compute the connectivity of the entire image using a cross template so
that line segments whose length are smaller than a typical value are
regarded as noise, and the similar thresholding process is applied to
noisy points produced by enhancement during MSR.

\textbf{C. Centerline tracking.} After getting the binary images of
vascular structure, we apply the centerline extraction method using
multi-stencils fast marching (MSFM). Our method is based on Hassouna's
work~\cite{Hassouna} and by solving the Eikonal equation at each point
under several stencils which cover eight neighbors in 2D space and
selecting the one which satisfies the upwind condition the most, this
way we can achieve better accuracy.

%%%% Note to Xinglong, Fei
%%%% what is machine intensifier
%%%% what is optical center???
%%%% I don't understand these terms

%%%% Note to Xinglong, Fei
%%%% All the math from here till the end of this section needs to be
%%%% re-done
%%%%

\textbf{D. 3D reconstruction of coronary arteries.} In our method, we treat
the space between the image intensifier and the optical center of the X-Ray
machine as an Markov Random Field. The 3D space is divided into 2D slices
which we call layer $L=(l_1, l_2, ... l_n)$ using a given depth increment.
Each depth can be assigned with a label $l_{i}$. Meanwhile, each skeleton
point on reference view $I_{1}$ corresponds to a projected line from the
source to the intensifier through all the layers.

%%%%NOTE TO Xinglong and Fei
%%%% The following math part should be re-written with better math
%%%% and simplified math notations

%%%% I changed Val_{ith} to V_{ith}, and make sure that my modifications
%%%% are all correct!!!

  \centering
  % Requires \usepackage{graphicx}
  \includegraphics[width=7.0in]{experiments_full.png}\\
  \caption{Reconstructed vessels from synthetic
    data.}\label{fig:experiments_full}
\end{figure*}

Therefore, for a given pixel $p$ on $I_{1}$, the pair $(p, l_{i})$ uniquely
identifies a point in 3D space. So, the goal of 3D reconstruction is to
optimally assign a label $l_{i}$ to each $p$ on the centerline of the
reference view $I_{1}$. This problem can be formulated as an energy
minimization problem subject to the constraint of connectivity and
topological structures. Our goal is to find the minimum energy and we use
the belief propagation (BP)~\cite{felzenszwalb2006efficient} method to
derive the solution. In our method, we define $V_{p,q}(f_{p}, f_{q})$ as the
Euclidean distance between point $p$ and $q$. We define $D_{p}(f_{p})$ as
the \emph{color consistency} which can be formulated as $D_{p}(f_{p}) =
\frac{1}{(n-1)} \sum_{i=2}^{n} P_{i}(x,y),$ where $P_{i}(x,y)$ is the
projection value of point $p$ on the $i$-th view, and we define it as
\begin{equation}
P_{i}(x,y) =
\left\{
  \begin{array}{lll}
    W_{h}, & \hbox {$p(x,y) \in I_{i}$} \\
    W_{l},  & \hbox {$ \mathcal{N}(p(x,y)) \notin I_{i}$} \\
    W_{a}, & \hbox {otherwise}
  \end{array}
\right.,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
W_{a} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} V_{i}(x,y),
\end{equation}
where $p(x,y)\in I_{i}$ means that $p(x,y)$ is a valid centerline point of
$I_{i}$, $W_{h}$ and $W_{l}$ are two constants that control the highest and
lowest value, respectively. For a grey scale image, $\mathcal{N}(p(x,y))$
includes 8 neighbors of point $p(x,y)$. If $p(x,y)$ can not be found in
$I_{i}$, we will compute its 8 neighbors and obtain the average value as the
value of point $p(x,y)$. If none of its neighbors is valid, it could be
assigned with $ W_{l}$. Our algorithm includes two main steps, message
propagation and energy minimization computation. In the message propagation,
the color value of point $p(x,y) \in I_{1}$ is updated as $ V_{p} = V_{p-1}
+ \alpha \min D_{p,q}(f_p, f_q)+ (1-\alpha)V(p_{min})$ where $\alpha$ is a
constant controlling the weight its neighbors' \emph{color
  consistency} and \emph{distance consistency}. And $D_{p,q}(f_p, f_q)$
denotes the distance from $p(x,y)$ to its neighbors, $V(p_{min})$ denotes
the value of the minimum distance point.

In our energy minimization, different from typical BP, the current energy of
the $i$-th layer is defined as $e_{i}(p_{i}) = \min[\gamma D(p_{i}, q) +
(1-\gamma)V(q) + e_{i-1}(q)]$ in which $q$ denotes the projected sample
depth of $\mathcal{N}^o(p(x,y))$ which includes all neighbors of $p_{i}$
except $p_{i}$ itself.

Finally, we compute the minimum sum of all the grouped vessel
skeletons' cost, and obtain the optimal solution for the entire vessel
skeleton tree. The entire system pipeline is illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:Pipeline}.

\section{EXPERIMENTS}

We test our reconstruction method on synthetic data and real clinical
data, respectively. Compared with real data, the reconstruction of
synthetic data is easy to assess because of the vessel ground truth.
The final reconstruction results of synthetic data are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:experiments_full}.

In the top row of Fig.~\ref{fig:experiments_full}, the yellow lines
indicate the reconstructed skeleton using our method. The green lines
indicate the ground truth obtained in our simulation platform. The
white box is the bounding box of the ground truth. For the real data
reconstruction results, the views and reconstructed results can be
found in Fig.~\ref{fig:real_reconstructed_data}.

\section{CONCLUSION}

We have presented a novel method of reconstructing 3D vessels from
angiograms. The fundamental idea is to treat the 3D space from the X-Ray
machine optical center (receiver) and the X-Ray machine intensifier
(emitter) as slices. In this way, we are able to transform the
reconstruction problem into an energy minimization problem. The experimental
results from both synthetic and real clinical data show our method is useful
and works well.
