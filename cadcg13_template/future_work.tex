We use three projection views to reconstruct the coronary arteries. In our
current work, the corresponding image pairs are selected out by hand
according to the cardiac cycle. This can be accurate but slow down the
reconstruction speed. In the near future, we want to find some method to
find the corresponding images automatically. Also, our work is divided into
three main parts and the data processing consumes much time, we want to
accelerate the image processing step, as well as the reconstruction step
with the help of GPU. Finally, we want to build a real-time online
reconstruction system.
