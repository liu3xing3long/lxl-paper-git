In this paper, we present an efficient 3D vessels reconstruction algorithm
based on multi-views of X-ray Angiography assisting interventional surgery.
First, we extract the vascular-like structures from the image sequences
using a geometrical analysis of multi-scale Hessian matrix eigen-system and
use the fast marching method to extract the skeleton of the structure, from
which we derive the vascular topological configurations. Second, we regard
the 3D space as a Markov Random Field and formulate the reconstruction
problem as an energy minimization problem with consistent, continuous and
topological constraints to coarsely register and reconstruct the 3D vessels.
Third, we refine the reconstructed vessels to register and reconstruct the
3D vessels accurately. We demonstrate our system in coronary arteries
reconstruction for percutaneous coronary intervention surgery to help
doctors learn about the configurations of the coronary arteries of specific
patient during operation. We envision that our system will be used for
clinic treatment to advance vessel reconstruction for diagnosis and therapy
in the near future.
